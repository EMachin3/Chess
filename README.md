# Chess
This is my attempt to create a chess game. Currently a work in progress.      
This will be my largest project ever, and will likely take quite some time to complete.

# How to run      
First, make sure you have Java installed. Put each .java file in the same directory, then open the directory in cmd.     
Type "javac (filename).java" without quotations for each file.        
Finally, type "java Main" to execute the program. Currently, only pawns can move.
